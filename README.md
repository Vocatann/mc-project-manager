# Minecraft Todo List 🪓⛏️

This is a personal project designed as a todo list for Minecraft players to track items they need to collect or craft. It allows you to add items to a list, adjust their quantities, remove items, and display amounts in Minecraft storage units like stacks, double chests, or shulkers. 🎒

## Features ✨

- Add items to your todo list 📋
- Increase or decrease item quantities ➕➖
- Remove items from the list 🗑️
- View quantities in stacks, double chests, or shulkers 📦

## Planned Features 🔮

- Make better categorization of items

## Status 📜

This was a solo experiment with no active users. The core functionality works, but some planned features were never implemented. The repository is now archived, and I won’t be adding new features or fixing bugs.
